================================================================================

Installation complete!
If something broke up I'm sorry dude, software happens.

Now it's up to you, remember to:
- Set Alfred configuration to ~/.config/
- Set iTerm configuration to ~/.config/

Everything should be up and running but if you have to configure anything
remember to add that to this repo.
